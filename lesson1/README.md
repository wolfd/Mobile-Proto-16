# Lesson 1 - Learning Goals

## Assignment

Your homework for next class is to answer the following questions in a 1-2 page paper. It doesn't have to be formal writing. This is just to us. It will also help us tailor the curriculum to your goals. We also understand that you might not know what you want to learn yet (maybe you realize later you want to understand an app's lifecycle) - that's okay.

In your paper, please answer the following questions:

* What are your learning goals for the semester?
* What are you most excited about?
* What are you worried about?
* What would you like the teaching team to know about your previous experiences (informal or formal) with software or independent studying that would help us plan for the term?

Some examples for learning goals: I want to learn more github skills, I want to learn how to scope a project better, I want to learn UI/UX, etc.
